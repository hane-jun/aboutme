# Welcome! üëã

I'm **Hane** and I'm glad you dropped by.
Currently a **Senior Consultant @ IBM**, with past work experience in Tech, Sales, and Finance.
With 5+ years of experience in client-facing consulting and analytics, my main superpower is the ability to empathize and understand the needs of my client/customer.
Using this, I identify their key problems and build solutions that can bridge the gaps.

I'm always opened to meeting new people, and learning new things. Let's connect!
