Welcome! 👋 I’m Hane and I’m glad you dropped by.\n
I am currently a Senior Consultant @ IBM, with past work experience in Tech, Sales, and Finance. 🤓 \n
My main superpower is the ability to empathize and understand the needs of my client/customer. Using this, I identify their key problems and build solutions that can bridge the gaps.
I’m always opened to meeting new people, and learning new things. Let’s connect!
